# Service Accounts

Service accounts are used by "bots" / software to access the k8s API

```bash
# Create a service account
k create sa <new-sa-name>

# View service accounts
k get sa

# Vew the token created by the SA
k describe sa <new-sa-name>
```

The token that is generated by the SA is what is used to by the app to talk to the Kube API  
The token is stored as a `secret`  

We can then use the token to call the api with curl.  
`curl https://<controller>:6443/api -insecure --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>"`

If the third party application is hosted on the kubernetes cluster that the secret is on then 
we can mount the service account token secret as a volume and use it in the pod.

Every namespace has a `default` service account created.  
By default, when a pod is created, the default service account is mounted automatically.

The default service account has very limited permissions.

To disable mounting the default service account, set 
`automountServiceAccountToken: false` in the pod `spec` section.

Use a custom service account in a pod spec:

```bash
spec:
  container:
    #Contaer stuff
  serviceAccount: service-account-name
```
