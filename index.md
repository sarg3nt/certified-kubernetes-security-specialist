# Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist Training Notes

These are the notes I've taken while taking the [Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist](https://kodekloud.com/courses/certified-kubernetes-security-specialist-cks/) course on KodeKloud.

These notes are not meant to be a complete record of the training but to be used as a training aid. I'm not going to be recording those things I already know really well.
