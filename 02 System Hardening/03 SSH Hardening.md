# SSH Hardening

```sh
# Generate a new public private key pair into the ~/.ssh directory
ssh-keygen # default type is '-t rsa'

# Copy public key to remote server
ssh-copy-id mark@node01
# this will copy the public key to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file as a new line
```

## Disable `ssh` for `root` and Password Based Authentication

```sh
# edit
vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# and set PermitRootLogin to no
PermitRootLogin no
 
# Disable password based authentication
# Make sure there are public keys that can access the node first
PasswordAuthentication no

# exit and save then reload sshd
systemctl reload sshd
```
