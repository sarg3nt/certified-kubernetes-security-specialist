# Disable Open Ports

```sh
# Check if port is open and listening
netstat -an | grep -w LISTEN

# On Ubuntu check what ports are used by what services
cat /etc/services | grep -w 53
# domain 53/tcp       # Domain Name Server
# domain 53/udp

# OR
netstat -natp | grep 9090

# Look at documentation for what software needs what ports open
```
